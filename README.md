## Proposed System
Today one cannot afford to rely on the fallible human 
beings of be really wants to stand against today’s merciless 
competition where not to wise saying “to err is human” no 
longer valid, it’s outdated to rationalize your mistake. So, to 
keep pace with time, to bring about the best result without 
malfunctioning and greater efficiency so to replace the 
unending heaps of flies with a much sophisticated hard disk of 
the computer. 
One has to use the data management software. Software 
has been an ascent in atomization various organisations. Many 
software products working are now in markets, which have 
helped in making the organizations work easier and efficiently. 
Data management initially hadto maintain a lot of ledgers 
and a lot of paperwork has to be done but now software 
producton this organization has made their work fasterand 
easier. Now only this software has to beloaded on the 
computer and work can be done. 
This prevents a lot of time and money. Thework becomes 
fully automated and any information regarding the
