# Banking-Management-System

“BANK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM”. This project is useful for the bank employees as well as the customers to keep a track of account details. The emerging of digital system made information available on finger tips. By automating the transactions, one can view the details as and when required in no time. This project emphases on creation of new customer, managing the existing account holders in the bank, by making digital system one can generate daily reports, monthly reports and annual reports which can enhance the system.
## Objective
The objective of this project is to let the students apply the programming knowledge into a real- world situation/problem and exposed the students how programming skills helps in developing a good software. 
1. Write programs utilizing modern software tools. 
2. Apply object oriented programming principles 
effectively when developing small to medium sized 
projects. 
3. Write effective procedural code to solve small to 
medium sized problems. 
4. Students will demonstrate a breadth of knowledge in 
computer science, as exemplified in the areas of 
systems, theory and software development. 
5. Students will demonstrate ability to conduct a research 
or applied Computer Science project, requiring writing 
and presentation skills which exemplify scholarly style in 
computer science.


## Proposed System
Today one cannot afford to rely on the fallible human 
beings of be really wants to stand against today’s merciless 
competition where not to wise saying “to err is human” no 
longer valid, it’s outdated to rationalize your mistake. So, to 
keep pace with time, to bring about the best result without 
malfunctioning and greater efficiency so to replace the 
unending heaps of flies with a much sophisticated hard disk of 
the computer. 

One has to use the data management software. Software 
has been an ascent in atomization various organisations. Many 
software products working are now in markets, which have 
helped in making the organizations work easier and efficiently. 
Data management initially hadto maintain a lot of ledgers 
and a lot of paperwork has to be done but now software 
producton this organization has made their work fasterand 
easier. Now only this software has to beloaded on the 
computer and work can be done. 

This prevents a lot of time and money. Thework becomes 
fully automated and any information regarding the 
organization can beobtained by clicking the button. Moreover, 
nowit’s an age of computers of and automating such an 
organization gives the better look.


## System Development Life Cycle

The systems development life cycle is a project management 
technique that divides complex projects into smaller, more 
easily managed segments or phases. 
  
  Software development projects typically include initiation, 
planning, design, development, testing, implementation, and 
maintenance phases. However, the phases may be divided 
differently depending on the organization involved. 
  
  For example, initial project activities might be designated 
as request, requirements-definition, and planning phases, or 
initiation, concept-development, and planning phases. End 
users of the system under development should be involved in 
reviewing the output of each phase to ensure the system is 
being built to deliver the needed functionality.

## Testing
Software Testing is an empirical investigation conducted 
to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of 
the product or service under test, with respect to the context in 
which it is intended to operate. Software Testing also provides 
an objective, independent view of the software to allow the 
business to appreciate and understand the risks at 
implementation of the software. Test techniques include, but 
are not limited to, the process of executing a program or 
application with the intent of finding software bugs. 
It can also be stated as the process of validating and verifying 
that a software program/application/product meets the 
business and technical requirements that guided its design and 
development, so that it works as expected and can be 
implemented with the same characteristics. Software Testing, 
depending on the testing method employed, can be 
implemented at any time in the development process, 
however the most test effort is employed after the 
requirements have been defined and coding process has been 
completed.

### Testing Methods
Software testing methods are traditionally divided into 
black box testing and white box testing. These two approaches 
are used to describe the point of view that a test engineer 
takes when designing test cases.

### Black Box Testing
Black box testing treats the software as a "black box," 
without any knowledge of internal implementation. Black box 
testing methods include: equivalence partitioning, boundary 
value analysis, all-pairs testing, fuzz testing, model-based 
testing, traceability matrix, exploratory testing and 
specification-based testing.

### Specification-based Testing
Specification-based testing aims to test the functionality 
of software according to the applicable requirements.[16] Thus, 
the tester inputs data into, and only sees the output from, the 
test object. This level of testing usually requires thorough test 
cases to be provided to the tester, who then can simply verify 
that for a given input, the output value (or behaviour), either 
"is" or "is not" the same as the expected value specified in the 
test case. Specification-based testing is necessary, but it is 
insufficient to guard against certain risks

### Advantages and Disadvantages
The black box tester has no "bonds" with the code, and a 
tester's perception is very simple: a code must have bugs. Using 
the principle, "Ask and you shall receive," black box testers find
bugs where programmers don't. But, on the other hand, black 
box testing has been said to be "like a walk in a dark labyrinth 
without a flashlight," because the tester doesn't know how the 
software being tested was actually constructed. 
That's why there are situations when (1) a black box tester 
writes many test cases to check something that can be tested 
by only one test case, and/or (2) some parts of the back end 
are not tested at all. Therefore, black box testing has the 
advantage of "an unaffiliated opinion," on the one hand, and 
the disadvantage of "blind exploring," on the other.

### White Box testing
White box testing, by contrast to black box testing, is 
when the tester has access to the internal data structures and 
algorithms (and the code that implement these)

#### Types of white box testing:-
The following types of white box testing exist:
1. api testing - Testing of the application using Public 
and Private APIs.
2. Code coverage - creating tests to satisfy some criteria 
of code coverage.
For example, the test designer can create tests to cause all 
statements in the program to be executed at least once.
3. fault injection methods.
4. mutation testingmethods.
5. static testing - White box testing includes all static 
testing.

### Code Completeness Evaluation
White box testing methods can also be used to evaluate 
the completeness of a test suite that was created with black 
box testing methods. This allows the software team to examine 
parts of a system that are rarely tested and ensures that the 
most important function points have been tested.
Two common forms of code coverage are:
1. FunctionCoverage: Which reports on functions 
executed and
2. StatementCoverage: Which reports on the number of 
lines executed to complete the test.

They both return coverage metric, measured as a percentage
